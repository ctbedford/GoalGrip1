- **Log Persistence**: All logs stored in localStorage for cross-session debugging
- **Test Result History**: Track feature and API test results over time
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter logs by level, area, and timestamp
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor execution time for tests and operations

For detailed information, refer to the [Debug Infrastructure Documentation](./DEBUG_INFRASTRUCTURE.md).

### Frontend Debugging

- Structured logs with level and feature area tagging
- Feature verification and testing framework
- React Developer Tools for component inspection
- Network tab for API request monitoring

### Backend Debugging

- Express middleware logging for API requests
- Error catching and detailed error responses
- Storage operation logging
- API testing utilities with performance metrics

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Goal not appearing after creation**
   - Check API response in network tab
   - Verify storage implementation in `storage.ts`
   - Check React Query cache invalidation

2. **Progress not updating**
   - Verify progress log API endpoint
   - Check goal update logic in storage
   - Verify React Query cache invalidation

3. **UI not reflecting data changes**
   - Check React Query refetching configuration
   - Verify component re-rendering triggers

4. **Form submission issues**
   - Check form validation in browser console
   - Verify Zod schema validation
   - Check API error responses

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement feature testing framework (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ Add automated API testing (COMPLETED)
3. ✅ Add test result persistence (COMPLETED)
4. Enhance test coverage with more comprehensive test cases
5. Implement visual testing for UI components
6. Set up continuous integration testing

## Conclusion

The current implementation has passed comprehensive testing for all completed features. The basic functionality is working correctly, with UI components displaying data properly and API endpoints responding as expected. 

The newly implemented debug infrastructure has significantly enhanced our testing capabilities, providing:

1. **Automated Testing**: Feature testing and API testing frameworks automate the verification of core functionality
2. **Test Result Persistence**: Historical test results stored in localStorage for trend analysis
3. **Performance Metrics**: Measuring execution time for features and API endpoints
4. **Structured Logging**: Categorized logs with levels and feature areas for efficient debugging
5. **Debug Console UI**: Intuitive interface for managing tests and reviewing logs

With this robust infrastructure in place, we can more confidently proceed with the implementation of advanced features in Batch 3, knowing we have the tools to properly test and verify their functionality.

This testing document will be updated as new features are implemented in Batch 3 and beyond.
