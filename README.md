```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed",
    "details": [
      { 
        "field": "deadline", 
        "expected": "ISO8601 date string", 
        "received": "2025-04-07", 
        "constraint": "format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ" 
      }
    ],
