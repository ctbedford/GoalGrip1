# Unified Debug Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the architecture and implementation of the unified debug infrastructure for the GOAL:SYNC application. The debug infrastructure is designed to seamlessly integrate feature status tracking with test execution, providing comprehensive insights into the application's health and quality.

## Architecture

The unified debug infrastructure is built around the following key components:

1. **Enhanced Feature Status System**
   - Extended to include test-related information
   - Bidirectional relationship between feature implementation and test status
   - Automatic status updates based on test execution results

2. **Feature Test Service**
   - Maintains mappings between features and their associated tests
   - Provides methods for retrieving test information for features
   - Updates feature status based on test results

3. **React Hook Integration**
   - Custom hooks for accessing enhanced feature information
   - Real-time updates when test statuses change
   - Filtering and statistics calculation

4. **Unified Debug Dashboard**
   - Visual representation of feature and test status
   - Filtering and search capabilities
   - Interactive test execution

5. **Feature Detail Modal**
   - In-depth view of a specific feature
   - Test execution and monitoring
   - Notes and dependency visualization

## Data Model

### Enhanced Feature Status

The feature status model has been enhanced to include test-related information:

```typescript
interface EnhancedFeatureStatus {
  // Core feature metadata
  name: string;
  area?: FeatureArea;
  
  // Implementation status
  implemented: boolean;
  implementedAt?: Date;
  
  // Test status
  testStatus: 'not_tested' | 'passed' | 'failed' | 'partially_passed' | 'skipped';
  lastTested?: Date;
  
  // Documentation
  notes: string[];
}
```

### Feature Test Info

Tests are associated with features and include detailed information:

```typescript
interface FeatureTestInfo {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  featureName: string;  // Associated feature name
  area?: FeatureArea;
  status: TestStatus;
  lastRun?: Date;
  duration?: number;
  error?: string;
  dependencies?: string[];
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Feature Test Service

The Feature Test Service is responsible for maintaining the associations between features and tests, as well as providing methods for retrieving and updating test information:

1. **Mapping Initialization**
   - Associates tests with features based on area or name matching
   - Creates bidirectional mappings for quick lookups

2. **Test Information Retrieval**
   - Provides tests for a specific feature
   - Retrieves test summary statistics

3. **Status Updates**
   - Notifies listeners when test statuses change
   - Updates feature statuses based on test results

### React Hook Integration

The `useFeatureTests` hook provides a clean API for components to access the enhanced feature information:

```typescript
const {
  features,              // All enhanced features
  isLoading,             // Loading state
  getFeatureTests,       // Function to get tests for a feature
  getFeatureTestSummary, // Function to get test summary
  getFeature,            // Function to get a specific feature
  filterFeaturesByTestStatus, // Function to filter features
  overallStats           // Overall statistics
} = useFeatureTests();
```

### Test Execution Integration

Test execution is integrated with the feature status system:

1. **Context Creation**
   - Creates execution context for tracing test runs
   - Links tests with features for proper attribution

2. **Status Updates**
   - Automatically updates test status after execution
   - Propagates changes to feature status
   - Notifies components of changes via hooks

3. **Error Handling**
   - Captures test failures and errors
   - Associates error information with test results
   - Displays in the UI for debugging

## User Interface Components

### Unified Debug Dashboard

The Unified Debug Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the application's status:

1. **Summary Cards**
   - Shows total features, tests passed, tests failed, etc.
   - Visualizes overall health with progress bars

2. **Filtering Controls**
   - Filter by area, implementation status, test status
   - Search features by name

3. **Tabbed Interface**
   - Features tab: Shows all features with their status
   - Tests tab: Shows all tests with their status
   - Status tab: Shows summary statistics and correlations

### Feature Detail Modal

The Feature Detail Modal provides a detailed view of a specific feature:

1. **Feature Information**
   - Shows name, area, implementation status
   - Displays implementation notes and timestamps

2. **Test Execution**
   - Lists all tests associated with the feature
   - Provides controls to run individual tests
   - Shows test results and errors

3. **Dependencies**
   - Visualizes test dependencies
   - Shows relationships between tests

## Integration Examples

### Running Tests for a Feature

```typescript
// In the Unified Debug Dashboard
const handleRunFeatureTests = async (featureName: string) => {
  const tests = getFeatureTests(featureName);
  if (!tests.length) return;
  
  // Mark all as running
  const newRunningState: Record<string, boolean> = {};
  tests.forEach(test => {
    newRunningState[test.id] = true;
  });
  setIsTestRunning(prev => ({ ...prev, ...newRunningState }));
  
  const contextId = createLoggingContext('Feature Tests', featureName);
  
  try {
    // Run each test in sequence
    for (const test of tests) {
      await runFeatureTest(test.id);
    }
  } finally {
    completeContext(contextId, 'success');
    
    // Mark all as not running
    const completedState: Record<string, boolean> = {};
    tests.forEach(test => {
      completedState[test.id] = false;
    });
    setIsTestRunning(prev => ({ ...prev, ...completedState }));
  }
};
```

### Updating Feature Status

```typescript
// In the Feature Test Service
public updateFeatureTestStatus(testIds: string[]): void {
  // Refresh the test results
  const testResults = getTestResults();
  
  // Update features associated with these tests
  const updatedFeatures = new Set<string>();
  
  testIds.forEach(testId => {
    const featureName = this.testFeatureMap.get(testId);
    if (featureName) {
      updatedFeatures.add(featureName);
    }
  });
  
  // Notify listeners if features were updated
  if (updatedFeatures.size > 0) {
    this.notifyListeners();
  }
}
```
