# Unified Debug Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation approach for consolidating all debug features into a unified, context-aware debug dashboard for the Goal Tracker application.

## Core Principles
- **Context Awareness**: All debug views filter by selected feature when in feature context
- **Consistent Design**: Common visual language across all debug components
- **Integrated Experience**: Seamless navigation between different debug aspects
- **Implementation Transparency**: Clear status indication for all features

## Implementation Batches

### Batch 1: Core Dashboard & Navigation Structure âœ…
- [x] Create UnifiedDebugDashboard.tsx component
- [x] Implement top-level navigation tabs
- [x] Structure feature list with expanded details
- [x] Set up context provider for selected feature

### Batch 2: Feature-Detail Experience ðŸ”„
- [ ] Design comprehensive feature detail view
- [ ] Implement tabs: Overview, Implementation, Tests, Run Tests, Logs
- [ ] Create feature context provider to pass selected feature to all components
- [ ] Add feature filtering across all debug sections

### Batch 3: Test Integration ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Connect test runner to feature details
- [ ] Implement "Run Tests" tab functionality
- [ ] Add test result visualization in feature context
- [ ] Create test history tracking per feature

### Batch 4: Logs & API Integration ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Implement feature-specific log filtering
- [ ] Connect API dashboard with feature context
- [ ] Add API endpoint grouping by feature
- [ ] Create feature-API relationship visualization

### Batch 5: Performance & Documentation ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Add feature-specific performance metrics
- [ ] Implement performance impact visualization
- [ ] Create feature-specific documentation sections
- [ ] Add dependency visualization between features

## Technical Approach

### State Management
```typescript
// Feature context to share selected feature across components
interface FeatureContext {
  selectedFeature: FeatureStatus | null;
  selectFeature: (feature: FeatureStatus | null) => void;
  selectedTab: string;
  setSelectedTab: (tab: string) => void;
}

// Shared filter state
interface FilterState {
  area: FeatureArea | 'all';
  implementationStatus: 'all' | 'implemented' | 'not-implemented';
  testStatus: 'all' | 'tested' | 'not-tested';
}
```

### Component Structure
```
UnifiedDebugDashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ DebugNavigation (tabs)
â”œâ”€â”€ FeatureStatusList
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FeatureStatusItem
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ FeatureDetailModal
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ OverviewTab
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ ImplementationTab
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ TestsTab
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ RunTestsTab
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ LogsTab
â”œâ”€â”€ LogsPanel (filtered by selected feature)
â”œâ”€â”€ ApiDashboard (filtered by selected feature)
â”œâ”€â”€ PerformancePanel (filtered by selected feature)
â””â”€â”€ DocumentationPanel (filtered by selected feature)
```

### Data Flow
1. User selects a feature from the list
2. Feature context is updated with selected feature
3. All panels update to show feature-specific data
4. User can navigate between different debug aspects while maintaining feature context

## Optimizations
- Use React Context for sharing selected feature across components
- Implement virtualized lists for performance with many features
- Use memoization for expensive filtering operations
- Batch update UI when test results change
