# AI Agent Prompt Commands
ai_agent_commands:
  - name: "Get Feature Status"
    command: "!debug feature <feature_name>"
    description: "Get the implementation status, test results, and related issues for a specific feature"
    implementation: |
      1. Query `/api/debug/ai/feature-status?name=<feature_name>`
      2. Parse response to extract implementation status, test results, and issues
      3. Generate natural language summary with key metrics
      4. Provide actionable recommendations based on status
    examples:
      - prompt: "!debug feature goal-tracking"
        expected_response: |
          ## Goal Tracking Feature Status
          
          **Implementation**: ✅ Complete
          **Test Status**: ✅ 12/12 tests passing
          **Last Verified**: March 10, 2025
          
          ### Recent Changes
          - Added progress visualization (2 days ago)
          - Fixed deadline calculation bug (5 days ago)
          
          ### Potential Issues
          - Performance degrades with >100 goals
          
          ### Recommendations
          - Consider implementing pagination for large goal sets
      
  - name: "Run Feature Tests"
    command: "!debug test <feature_name> [--all]"
    description: "Run tests for a specific feature or all features and report results"
    implementation: |
      1. Call `/api/debug/runFeatureTest` with appropriate parameters
      2. Monitor test execution through polling `/api/debug/ai/test-results`
      3. Process results and identify any failures or warnings
      4. Generate summary with detailed error information and suggestions
    examples:
      - prompt: "!debug test goal-creation"
        expected_response: |
          ## Running tests for Goal Creation feature...
          
          ✅ Goal creation with valid data: PASSED (120ms)
          ✅ Goal creation with categories: PASSED (130ms)
          ✅ Goal validation: PASSED (85ms)
          ❌ Goal creation with deadline: FAILED (210ms)
          
          ### Error Details
          ```
          Expected deadline to be stored as ISO string, but was stored as Date object
          at GoalService.createGoal (src/services/goal.service.ts:42:7)
          ```
          
          ### Suggested Fix
          Add date conversion in the `createGoal` method:
          ```typescript
          deadline: deadline instanceof Date ? deadline.toISOString() : deadline
          ```
      
  - name: "Analyze Performance"
    command: "!debug perf <endpoint_or_feature> [--period=<time_period>]"
    description: "Analyze performance metrics for a specific endpoint or feature"
    implementation: |
      1. Query performance data from `/api/debug/ai/performance?target=<endpoint_or_feature>&period=<time_period>`
      2. Generate statistical analysis of response times, error rates, and throughput
      3. Compare current metrics to historical baseline
      4. Identify anomalies and potential bottlenecks
    examples:
      - prompt: "!debug perf /api/goals --period=7d"
        expected_response: |
          ## Performance Analysis: /api/goals
          
          **Time Period**: Last 7 days
          **Avg Response Time**: 87ms (↑5% from baseline)
          **95th Percentile**: 210ms (↑12% from baseline)
          **Error Rate**: 0.2% (↓30% from baseline)
          **Throughput**: 120 req/min (peak)
          
          ### Anomalies Detected
          - Response time spike on March 9, 2025 (320ms avg)
          - Throughput drop on March 7, 2025 (40% below normal)
          
          ### Recommendations
          - Investigate query optimization for goal filtering
          - Consider adding caching for frequent queries
      
  - name: "Generate Status Report"
    command: "!debug report [--detailed] [--format=<format>]"
    description: "Generate a comprehensive status report of the application"
    implementation: |
      1. Gather data from multiple debug endpoints to build a complete picture
      2. Analyze feature statuses, test results, performance metrics, and error logs
      3. Identify key insights, trends, and potential issues
      4. Generate formatted report with appropriate level of detail
    examples:
      - prompt: "!debug report --detailed --format=markdown"
        expected_response: |
          # GOAL:SYNC Application Status Report
          
          ## Summary
          - **Features**: 24/25 implemented (96%)
          - **Tests**: 142/150 passing (94.7%)
          - **Performance**: Within acceptable parameters
          - **Error Rate**: 0.3% (last 24 hours)
          
          ## Feature Status
          | Feature | Implementation | Tests | Last Updated |
          |---------|---------------|-------|--------------|
          | Dashboard | Complete | 18/20 passing | Mar 10, 2025 |
          | Goal Creation | Complete | 15/15 passing | Mar 8, 2025 |
          | Goal Tracking | Complete | 20/20 passing | Mar 9, 2025 |
          | Analytics | In Progress | 5/10 passing | Mar 7, 2025 |
          
          ## Critical Issues
          1. Analytics dashboard fails to load with >50 goals
          2. Intermittent 503 errors on progress update endpoint
          
          ## Recommendations
          1. Prioritize completion of Analytics feature
          2. Investigate progress update endpoint stability
          3. Consider performance optimization for dashboard loading
      
  - name: "Debug Error"
    command: "!debug error <error_id_or_message>"
    description: "Analyze a specific error and suggest solutions"
    implementation: |
      1. Search error logs via `/api/debug/ai/error-search?query=<error_id_or_message>`
      2. Analyze error context, stack trace, and related logs
      3. Match against known error patterns
      4. Generate diagnostic information and suggested fixes
    examples:
      - prompt: "!debug error TypeError: Cannot read property 'deadline' of undefined"
        expected_response: |
          ## Error Analysis
          
          **Type**: TypeError
          **Message**: Cannot read property 'deadline' of undefined
          **Frequency**: 12 occurrences in last 24 hours
          **Affected Endpoints**: `/api/goals/progress`, `/api/dashboard/stats`
          
          ### Context
          This error occurs when trying to access the `deadline` property of a goal that doesn't exist.
          The most common cause is attempting to process deleted goals that are still referenced.
          
          ### Recommended Fix
          Add null checking before accessing goal properties:
          
          ```typescript
          // Before
          const daysLeft = calculateDaysLeft(goal.deadline);
          
          // After
          const daysLeft = goal ? calculateDaysLeft(goal.deadline) : 0;
          ```
          
          ### Related Issues
          - This error may be related to the intermittent 503 errors on the progress update endpoint
          - Consider implementing a cleanup routine to remove orphaned goal references

# Future Vision
future_vision: >
  The ultimate goal is to create a symbiotic relationship between the Replit AI Agent
  and the GOAL:SYNC application, where the AI becomes an integral part of the development
  and maintenance process. The AI will continuously monitor application health, proactively
  identify and diagnose issues, suggest optimizations, and assist developers in implementing
  new features. The debug infrastructure will evolve from a passive tool to an active
  participant in the development lifecycle, providing insights and recommendations that
  enhance both developer productivity and application quality.
